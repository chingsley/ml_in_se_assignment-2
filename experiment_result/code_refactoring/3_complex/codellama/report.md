    def refund(self, amount, account):
        print(f"Your refund of {amount} for {account} has been processed by Citibank")


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    processor = PaymentProcessor()
    chase_bank = ChaseBank("0002340112450")
    citibank_bank = CitibankBank("0101901889181")

    processor.pay(200, chase_bank.name)
    processor.pay(234, citibank_bank.name)
    processor.refund(78, chase_bank.name)

```

### Strength

It creates the right classes needed for the refactoring, but the method implementations are not great.

### Weakness

The provided solution has some weak points

- It fails to make proper use of inheritance and method override to implement a good strategy for the payment processor.
- It employs a method that iterates through every bank and attempts to call the pay or refund method on it. Which is both inefficient and confusing.
