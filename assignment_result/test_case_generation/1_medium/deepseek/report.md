STRENGTH:

- It structures the test correctly
- It understands from the script in the package.json that I'll prefer that the database be seeded, and it does so correctly.
- It covers a good number of the test cases
- Without an example it knows to perform a cleanup the afterAll hook

WEAKNESS:

- It missed the importation of certain reuired packages like jsonwebtoken;
- It misses testing for malformed ids, like passing a number instead of a string
- It doesn't configure the environment varialbe for the test cases correlcty
- It handles test isolation poorly failing to clear all mocks at the end of the test suit
