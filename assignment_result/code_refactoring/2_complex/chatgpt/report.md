STRENGTH:
The solution is not quite a typicial Strategy design pattern, but it's
a good alternative to it. It uses a 'register_bank' method to create
to set the payment processing strategy according to the registered bank.

WEAKNESS:
Apart from the use of plane string in the the register_bank method which can result in a typo error, it seems a pretty descent solution.
