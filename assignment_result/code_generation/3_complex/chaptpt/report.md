### STRENGTH

- Response was quick and generally in the right direction.
- It correctly implemented exception handling to catch any errors.

### WEAKNESS

- The solution did NOT work because it failed to correctly determine the project's root directly.
- Instead of going up two levels from \_\_file\_\_ based on the information in the prompt, it assumes that the target folders are located within the 'src' directly, as a result it didn't work.
